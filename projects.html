         <p>Designed a Smart Waste Management application using Figma to promote efficient waste disposal and recycling. The app enables users to track waste collection schedules, categorize recyclable materials, and access information on eco-friendly waste management practices. It includes features like user authentication, waste processing details, vehicle tracking, product recycling information, and a collection calendar. The intuitive interface ensures seamless navigation, enhancing user engagement in sustainable waste management.</p>

        <p>Developed a hardware-based Obstacle Detection System using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a buzzer. The system continuously monitors its surroundings and triggers an audible alert when an obstacle is detected within a predefined range. The project demonstrates real-time distance measurement, efficient object detection, and an alert mechanism for applications in robotics, automation, and assistive devices. </p>

        <h2>3.Ramdom Number Guessing Game</h2><br>
        <p>Build a Random Number Guessing Game which is simple simple yet engaging Java-based console application where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the number is too high or too low, and keeps track of the number of attempts. Once the correct number is guessed, the total attempts are displayed, and players can choose to replay. This project highlights fundamental Java concepts such as random number generation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling</p>
